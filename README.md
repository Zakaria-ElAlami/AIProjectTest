# AI Warmup Projects 🚀

A collection of starter projects exploring different domains of Artificial Intelligence. These projects were built to establish a foundation in NLP, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision using Python 3.11.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. 🧠 Smart To-Do List (Rule-Based NLP)
A task manager that uses keyword matching logic to automatically categorize tasks into "Work," "Study," "Groceries," etc.
* **Concepts:** Python Dictionaries, String Manipulation, Rule-Based Logic.

### 2. 📧 Spam Classifier (Machine Learning)
A probabilistic model that detects spam emails using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
* **Tech Stack:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas.
* **Key Concept:** Bag-of-Words Vectorization, Supervised Learning.

### 3. ✌️ Rock Paper Scissors AI (Computer Vision)
A real-time game played via webcam. The AI detects hand gestures using skeletal tracking and determines the winner.
* **Tech Stack:** OpenCV, MediaPipe.
* **Key Concept:** Real-time Inference, Image Processing.
